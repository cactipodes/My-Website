                <p>The contract to design the dining room originally belonged to the Architect Thomas Jeckyll and was commissioned by Fredrick Leyland. Leyland ask for the room to be designed with “traditional European porcelain cabinets,” giving him ample room to display his collection. At some point during the project Jeckyll turned to Whistler for advice on the project, but Whistler had ideas of his own about what the room should look like. As time went on Jeckyll’s health was on the declined until he eventually went mad and died in an insane asylum leaving no one but Whistler to work on the project.

                He recreated an art installation of the room entitled Filthy Lucre: Whistler's Peacock Room Reimagined. It plays with the ideas of beauty, excess and the grotesque. While Whistler worked on the room, there was a growing animosity between him and Leyland for not doing the job he asked him to do. This room is a continuation of that story. At the end, Whistler painted the peacocks fighting and now, as their fighting has continued, they eviscerate each other as the walls around them crack and melt. <br> Visit their <a href="https://www.darrenwaterston.com/paintings/filthy-lucre">website</a>.</p>
