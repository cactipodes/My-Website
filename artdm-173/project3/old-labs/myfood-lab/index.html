            <h3>My Household Favorite</h3>
            <p>I love food. I can't just choose one favorite food. So, I decided to write about the dish that is most preferred in my household, Chili beans. I have two roommates, one of whom is my fiancée, and he absolutely loves chili beans, but he always ate it from a can. During the pandemic I decided I’d try to make chili from scratch, sort of, I’m kind of lazy. The ingredients made it so that the volume of chili was enough for at least six people, meaning our roommate got roped in. They weren’t complaining though, because hey, free food. So we’d get together about once a month to have chili beans and watch shows on the weekend during the pandemic.</p>

            <h3>The Ingredients</h3>
            <p>I mentioned I attempted to make chili beans from scratch but am kind of lazy, I should also mention busy. Anyway, few of the ingredients I use are fresh, most come out of cans.

                    <ul>
                        <li>1 - lb ground beef</li>
                        <li>3 - cups beef broth</li>
                        <li>2 - chipotle peppers in adobo sauce</li>

            <h3>Bringing It All Together</h3>
            <p>On med-high heat in a large pot add the beef and cook thoroughly. Drain any excess fat, a little fat is ok if you bought lean beef. Lower heat to medium and add the powder spices and stir till mixed completely (2-3 min). Once the spices are mixed add the chipotle peppers and tomato paste. Break up the pepper with a spatula and cook till the color of the mixture changes to a darker shade of red (approx. 4-5 min). Now stir in the rotel and the green chili’s (2-3 min). After the rotel and green chili’s have been mixed in, add the broth and beans. Depending on your preference, you can pour in the liquid from the beans or drain it. Bring the whole thing to a simmer and then lower the flame and continue cooking for 30 minutes or whenever, it’s technically ready to eat. ;)</p>

            <h3>Serve It However You like It</h3>
            <p>The way I typically serve this recipe is over steak fries, covered in cheddar jack cheese, but I've also made chili cheese dogs and burgers. For the cheese, finely shredded works best because of how it melts, but any shredded cheese will work. This chili is pretty versatile and is also really good all on its own. The only thing is it’s a big recipe, it serves at least 6. If you make it be sure there are plenty of people to share it with or you're willing to have it for several meals for a couple days.</p>
